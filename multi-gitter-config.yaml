commit-message: Update Jenkins baseline from 2.361.x to 2.387.x
pr-body: |
  _ðŸ¤– This is an autogenerated PR for updating the Jenkins baseline._

  Jenkins 2.361.x is subject to [seven](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2023-03-08/) security vulnerabilities coming from Jenkins itself, and has been removed from the Jenkins BOM.
  2.387.x is the second-oldest baseline, has no unresolved security vulnerabilities and is the recommended to use.

  Ping @NotMyFault if you have questions.
