commit-message: Replace deprecated 'hamcrest-*' modules with 'hamcrest'
pr-body: |
  _ðŸ¤– This is an automatic PR for replacing the deprecated 'hamcrest-*' modules with 'hamcrest'._

  All deprecated modules' code has been merged into 'hamcrest'.
  Consumers of `hamcrest-*` should replace the dependency with `hamcrest`, which is the drop-in module containing the code of the deprecated `hamcrest-*` modules.

  Ping `@NotMyFault` if you have questions.
